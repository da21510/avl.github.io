## Why we tend not to favor white-board exam?

### 1. Algorithms do not accurate reflect real work.
When was the last time you had to implement BubbleSort or HeapSort at work? Engineering aptitude is not necessarily tested.

### 2. Luck is a big factor (algorithm lottery)

### 3. Age discrimination.
Favors young engineers and recent grads. 

### 4. More time consuming for everyone.


### 5. Longer preparation time.
Need to memorize.
