Our white-board exam

## General Topics

* Arrays/Strings
* Binary Trees
* Linked Lists
* DFS/BFS
* Backtracking
* Dynamic programming


## Why we tend not to favor white-board exam?

### 1. Algorithms do not accurate reflect real work.

When was the last time you had to implement BubbleSort or HeapSort at work? Engineering aptitude is not necessarily tested.

### 2. Luck is a big factor (algorithm lottery)


### 3. Age discrimination.

Favors young engineers and recent grads. 

### 4. More time consuming for everyone.


### 5. Longer preparation time.

Need to memorize.
