## About us

We are a team of entrepreneurs from MIT and Standford. We studied engineering as undergraduates, and worked int the world of finance, trading, and consulting in New York and Chicago, before building startups in Silicon Vallery. We are now based in Asia.

We are fact-based and driven by root cause. 

## Values

Our 5 values are:

1. Results
1. Iteration
1. Transparency
1. Collaboration
1. Efficiency

Our values give guidelines on how to behave and are actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making; they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager.

It is most important to focus on Results. We trust fast Iteration and radical Transperancy will lead to Results. Our emphasis on Collaboration and Efficiency distinguish us from other companies.
